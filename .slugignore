# List of folders and files to ignore for the purpose of the Heroku build.
# Ignoring unnecessary files limits the size of the repo and the time it
# takes to build. See: <https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/slug-compiler>
# Ignored files will still be pushed to the Heroku remote repo, but not 
# compressed (into a "slug") and so discarded without being counted towards
# the size limit.
# `.slugignore` does *not* support negated `!` patterns.
